Existing methods either require an already-injective starting configuration, which is often not avail- able, or rely on sophisticated solving schemes. We propose a novel energy form, called Total Lifted Content (TLC), that is equipped with theoretical properties desirable for injectivity optimization. By lifting the simplices of the mesh into a higher dimension and measuring their contents (2D area or 3D volume) there, TLC is smooth over the entire embedding space and its global minima are always injective. The energy is simple to minimize using standard gradient-based solvers. Our method achieved 100% success rate on an extensive benchmark of embedding problems for triangular and tetrahedral meshes, on which existing methods only have varied success.","tags":[],"title":"Lifting Simplices to Find Injectivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Xingyi Du**","Xiaohan Liu","Dong-Ming Yan","Caigui Jiang","Juntao Ye","Hui Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589066868,"objectID":"6c7393a08cd803b5077ec493c7a7fe5c","permalink":"https://duxingyi-charles.github.io/publication/field-aligned-isotropic-surface-remeshing/","publishdate":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/field-aligned-isotropic-surface-remeshing/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel isotropic surface remeshing algorithm that automatically aligns the mesh edges with an underlying directional field. The alignment is achieved by minimizing an energy function that combines both centroidal Voronoi tessellation and the penalty enforced by a six-way rotational symmetry (6-RoSy) field. The CVT term ensures the uniform distribution of thevertices and the high remeshing quality, while the field constraint enforces the directional alignment of the edges. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has the advantages of both isotropic remeshing and field-aligned remeshing. We demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to the representative state-of-the-art approaches in various aspects.","tags":[],"title":"Field-Aligned Isotropic Surface Remeshing","type":"publication"}]
