&lt;p&gt;Mapping a source mesh into a target domain while preserving local injectivity is an important but highly non-trivial task. Existing methods either require an already-injective starting configuration, which is often not available, or rely on sophisticated solving schemes. We propose a novel energy form, called Total Lifted Content (TLC), that is equipped with theoretical properties desirable for injectivity optimization. By lifting the simplices of the mesh into a higher dimension and measuring their contents (2D area or 3D volume) there, TLC is smooth over the entire embedding space and its global minima are always injective. The energy is simple to minimize using standard gradient-based solvers. Our method achieved 100% success rate on an extensive benchmark of embedding problems for triangular and tetrahedral meshes, on which existing methods only have varied success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video demonstrates the process of our method on a complex example. The initial mapping has 3115 inverted triangles (colored red). Our method computes an injective mapping within 120 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to generate high quality quad mesh, a novel method based on field-aligned centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) is proposed. Target mesh vertices are first uniformly distributed on input mesh surface via CVT optimization. Then, field-aligned CVT is applied to align mesh edges to the underlying direction field. Next, an initial quad mesh is extracted by matching mesh edges and field directions. Meanwhile, singular vertices are detected and eliminated based on topology optimization. Finally, the output quad-dominant mesh is generated by merging adjacent triangle pairs. Experiments show that our method has the ability to generate field-aligned high quality quad-dominant mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a novel isotropic surface remeshing algorithm that automatically aligns the mesh edges with an underlying directional field. The alignment is achieved by minimizing an energy function that combines both centroidal Voronoi tessellation and the penalty enforced by a six-way rotational symmetry (6-RoSy) field. The CVT term ensures the uniform distribution of thevertices and the high remeshing quality, while the field constraint enforces the directional alignment of the edges. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has the advantages of both isotropic remeshing and field-aligned remeshing. We demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to the representative state-of-the-art approaches in various aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
