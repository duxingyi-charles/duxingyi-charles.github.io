abstract = {We present a novel representation of solid models for shape design. Like Constructive
Solid Geometry (CSG), the solid shape is constructed from a set of halfspaces without
the need for an explicit boundary structure. Instead of using Boolean expressions
as in CSG, the shape is defined by sparsely placed samples on the boundary of each
halfspace. This representation, called Boundary-Sampled Halfspaces (BSH), affords
greater agility and expressiveness than CSG while simplifying the reverse engineering
process. We discuss theoretical properties of the representation and present practical
algorithms for boundary extraction and conversion from other representations. Our
algorithms are demonstrated on both 2D and 3D examples.},
